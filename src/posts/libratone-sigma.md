Along with one other developer, I worked remotely for Antidote to create this YouTube 360° player module and landing page, promoting [Libratone](https://www.libratone.com/uk)'s Zipp speaker as well as [Sigma](http://www.sigmahq.com/)'s single _Nightingale_.

The video for _Nightingale_ was filmed by Sigma's fans using 360° cameras, so we created a player module from scratch to interface with the YouTube JavaScript API.
