A React-based visualisation app, allowing the user to enjoy seeing how close they are to the grave. Displays the number of weeks in a long (90 year) human life, along with the number of weeks lived by the user based on their birthdate.

Based on <a title="WaitButWhy's Your Life in Weeks post" href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html">WaitButWhy</a>'s graphs of the number of weeks/days in a 90 year human life. I built this app to see what they'd look like with the age of the user displayed on the graph.

Used TDD with Jest & Enzyme to get more familiar with their respective APIs.
