Working at ASOS head offices in Camden, I built microsites to continue ASOS' brand partnerships with PayPal and Hostelworld. Desktop and mobile builds & internationalised (UK, US, FR, DE) versions of each were created to meet a tight deadline. I used a custom Gulp setup to output static builds from Pug templates & output i18n from JSON files.
