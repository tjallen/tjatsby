I worked part-time for artist agents Phosphor Art, building various promos alongside maintaining their existing site.

Designed and developed landing pages for events Phosphor was involved with or attending, like the [AMV Marylebone Road stairwell exhibit](http://phosphorart.com/amv/) and [New Designers](http://phosphorart.com/saa/). 

I also helped run email campaigns like the [Phosphor Art postcard club](http://www.phosphorart.com/email/postcards/), creating HTML emails and response forms, along with a temporary email builder site using ProcessWire.
