# rot13ify

Chrome extension providing [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) encoding & decoding. Useful for hiding spoilers or other content from being seen at a casual glance.

## Installation
The extension isn't yet on the Chrome Web Store. Here is how to use in the meantime:

1. Download latest release from this repo's [Releases tab](https://github.com/tjallen/rot13ify/releases)
2. Unpack the .zip or .tar.gz
3. Go to the Chrome extensions page at [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
4. Check the 'Developer mode' checkbox
5. Click 'Load unpacked extension' and select the directory you unpacked

The extension should now be enabled. It'll appear in the list of extensions.

## Usage
Highlight the text you're looking to encode and right-click (or long press) to open the context menu. Click 'ROT13 encode/decode' in the context menu and the text you highlighted will be encoded. Use the same process to decode.
